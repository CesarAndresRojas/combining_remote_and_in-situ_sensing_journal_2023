abstract = {At the request of field researchers, investigators, GIS and image specialists, and data managers, we prepared the following data management practices that data collectors and providers should follow to improve the usability of their data sets. This guidance is provided for those who perform environmental measurements, compile data from various sources, prepare GIS coverages, and compile remote sensing images for environmental applications, although many of the practices may be useful for other data collection and archiving activities. We assembled what we feel are the most important practices that researchers could implement to make their data sets ready to share with other researchers. These practices could be performed at any time during the preparation of the data set, but we suggest that researchers plan for them before measurements are taken and implement them during measurements. The order of the practices is not necessarily sequential, as a researcher could provide draft data set metadata before any measurements are taken based on their planning. We introduce topics in the sections that follow and if additional resources are available, they are included in an Appendix.},
