    "abstract": "Data in this collection include water quality measurements gathered from a fleet of state-of-the-art and built-in-house robotic platforms deployed to Biscayne Bay of South Florida. Remote sensing images of the bay are also included. The data is organized in 4 levels. Level 1 contains data that is processed by it's originating source. Level 2 data contains data that was processed using third party software or custom computer programs. Level 3 data contains fused data. Level 4 data contains applications developed using data from previous levels.",
